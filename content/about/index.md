# About

Hi there, I am Josh! I do software engineering with a focus on infrastructure
and systems. This site is my space to write about topics ~relating to those
areas. Many posts on this site have accompanying videos on
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkFMkIX1Tb2s8CIgfzmUfLA). 

I am employed by VMware where I lead the technical direction of [Tanzu Community
Edition](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/community-edition). However, this
website is not affiliated with or a reflection of VMware's views.  Outside of
VMware, I have worked for a startups that heavily influenced the Kubernetes and
container space. Namely,
[CoreOS](https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/06/vmware-acquires-heptio-the-startup-founded-by-2-co-founders-of-kubernetes/)
and
[Heptio](https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/06/vmware-acquires-heptio-the-startup-founded-by-2-co-founders-of-kubernetes/).
Along that journey I co-wrote the book [Production
Kubernetes](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/production-kubernetes/9781492092292/).
